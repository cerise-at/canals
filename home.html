      <h1>Leeds & Liverpool Canal Trust</h1>
      <p>
        The Leeds & Liverpool Canal Society was formed in 1997. The Society grew
        out of a meeting that took place on Wednesday 9 April at The Coaching
        Inn, Warrington Road, Wigan, organised by Rev David Long and Mike
        Clarke.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the formation of the Society there was a small fellowship of
        ex-boatmen dedicated to keeping the memory of commercial boating alive
        and preserving Leeds & Liverpool wide beam boats. Their newsletter,
        edited by Alan Holden, was called Clogs & Gansey. The Society decided to
        retain this title for its own newsletter. Clogs & Gansey continues to
        this day as a three-times-a-year publication to inform members of
        heritage and contemporary issues associated with the Canal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Early activities of the Society included continuing the Heritage Boat
        meetings set up by Alan Holden, the reinstatement of rollers on Canal
        bridges, the creation of a meadow at Bank Newton, and organising walks
        along and around the canal towpath. The Society also received its first
        Award in 2009, the Waterways Renaissance Award for Education and
        Learning, working with Galloways, the Lancashire charity for the blind
        and partially-sighted. Since the transfer of ownership of Kennet to the
        Society in 2011, and its subsequent refurbishment under the Heritage
        Lottery Fund grant, much of the Societyâ€™s activity has focused on the
        use of Kennet at canal festivals, open days and for school visits.
