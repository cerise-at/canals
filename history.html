      <p>
        The Leeds & Liverpool Canal was built for its commercial potential. At
        one end of the Canal it was the merchants of Bradford that needed a
        supply of lime and access to growing colonial markets in Africa and
        America; and at the other end the merchants of Liverpool needed a supply
        of coal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marrying their respective requirements meant that in its most formative
        period there was almost constant discussion and disputation about the
        precise route that the Canal should take – something that changed even
        while the Canal was in the process of being built. Once opened, to great
        celebration, the Canal proved to be a most successful venture for its
        early investors and continued that way for the next hundred years,
        despite the growing competition from the railways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradual decline began after the First World War. The closure of the
        Bradford Canal in 1922 was a particular consequence of the difficulties
        encountered in the City of the Canal’s origin, whilst at the same time
        being emblematic of the general pressures on the British waterway
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decline of the Leeds & Liverpool Canal intensified after the Second
        World War, though it continued to offer a viable commercial option until
        the 1960s. The Leeds & Liverpool Canal was probably the country’s most
        resilient canal during this period; but reality took over in the mid-60s
        with the effective end of commercial traffic.
